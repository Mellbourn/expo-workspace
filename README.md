# monorepo with expo and npm

This is an experimental monorepo demonstrating that you can use expo with monorepos using npm workspaces.

I mainly followed [this official guide from expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/monorepos/), however, that is based on yarn, and it explicitly warns that it applies only to yarn.

I initially had a lot of problems, but they were fixed by cleaning the cache. You can do the same clean I did with `npm run clean`
